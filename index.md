Preferences, Pain Points and Priorities

Prelude
---
The Data Visualization Society released a census to understand the current landscape of data visualization. <br>
Participants are asked a variety of questions about their practice and background. <br><br>
Given the recent data science boom, I thought it would be great to see how different "generations" of practitioners differ in aspects covered in the survey. We can qualify these *"generations"* through respondents' years in professional experience.<br><br>

Out of the 1766 respondents, 1684 filled out this field.

Below is the distribution of respondents' years in professional experience.


While we see that the base of respondents skew to the younger side, the census also has decent representation from more tenured folk.

<b><i>"What technologies do you use to visualize data?"</i></b>

For the plot above, you read one dot as *"Of the people that belong in group x, _% of them use tool Y to visualize data."*<br><br>
The black tick indicates the *global average* - *"Of everyone that has answered the census, _% of them use tool Y to visualize data."*<br>
Graphs in the following sections follow a similar theme.

**Some insights,** 
1. Excel, Pen & Paper, Power BI and Illustrator are more widely adopted by tenured folk than younger folk.
2. Popular languages and libraries - R, Python and ggplot2 - are more used by newly minted practitioners.

<b><i>"What methods do you find most helpful in learning new data visualization skills?"</i></b>

Pain Points
---
<b><i>"What are your biggest frustrations with doing data visualization in your job?"</i></b>
<img src="/2020 Survey Viz/frus_respondents.png">

**Very recent practitioners (*5 or less years into their career*) are frustrated by their lack of technical expertise**<br>
Against the global average, younger folks tended to answer "lack of design expertise", "lack of technical skills", "learning new tools / approaches".
They show an aggressive focus on their technical capabilities.

**Lack of time, too much effort most felt by more tenured folk**<br>
More tenured folk answered "Lack of time" and "Too much effort spent on non-viz activity" significantly more than the global average.



<b><i>"What are the three most important issues facing data visualization?"</i></b>
<img src="/2020 Survey Viz/issu_respondents.png">

**Data visualization literacy, together with its perceived impact by the general public, is low"**<br>
More tenured folk champion these two statements, together with "data visualization not having a seat at the table."

**Younger respondents are more focused on software literacy**<br>
This is in theme with their frustrations - both are very focused on the tools of the trade.



Priorities
---
<b><i>"What area is your next priority for improving your data visualization skills?"</i></b>
<img src="/2020 Survey Viz/area_respondents.png">

**Data skills first, then design skills**<br>
* Respondents with less than 5 years into their careers focus on data skills.
* Respondents with 5 - 10 years focus on their design skills.


<b><i>"Which of the following would you be likely to use professional development funds on?"</i></b>
<img src="/2020 Survey Viz/devs_respondents.png">

**More tenured practitioners would use their funds for networking, unstructured learning**<br>
* We see this in how they answer the questions pertaining to attending conferences and joining associations.
* They also prefer "professional books" and "workshops / training seminars."

**Younger practitioners look for structured graduate coursework**
