Preferences, Pain Points and Priorities

Prelude
---
The Data Visualization Society released a census to understand the current landscape of data visualization. <br>
Participants are asked a variety of questions about their practice and background. <br><br>
Given the recent data science boom, I thought it would be great to see how different "generations" of practitioners differ in aspects covered in the survey. We can qualify these *"generations"* through respondents' years in professional experience.<br><br>

Out of the 1766 respondents, 1684 filled out this field.

Below is the distribution of respondents' years in professional experience.


While we see that the base of respondents skew to the younger side, the census also has decent representation from more tenured folk.

<b><i>"What technologies do you use to visualize data?"</i></b>

For the plot above, you read one dot as *"Of the people that belong in group x, _% of them use tool Y to visualize data."*<br><br>
The black tick indicates the *global average* - *"Of everyone that has answered the census, _% of them use tool Y to visualize data."*
Graphs in the following sections follow the same theme.

Some insights, 
1. Excel, Pen & Paper, Power BI and Illustrator are more widely adopted by tenured folk than younger folk.
2. Popular languages and libraries - R, Python and ggplot2 - are more used by newly minted practitioners.

<b><i>"What methods do you find most helpful in learning new data visualization skills?"</i></b>
